The house was split down the middle. Half the house was white and geometric-looking; an estate agent like Gloria Fortune would say it had a “sleek and modern” design. The other half was dark and wooden; Gloria would probably describe it as “warm and rustic”. The modern side was Max-Ernest’s mother’s side. The woodsy side was his father’s.

‘The prophecy’s quite clear and this Brenin was born on the right night, in the right place and at the right time. The trees have been watching him since he arrived, they seem satisfied he’s The One.’ ‘The trees could be wrong,’ Camelin mumbled in case he was overheard. He knew how fast word could travel from one tree to another. If Arrana, the ancient Hamadryad, heard him he’d be in big trouble. She lived in the oldest oak tree in the heart of Glasruhen Forest and was always very well informed.

‘Nora’s a Seanchai,’ explained Elan, lowering her voice. Jack had never heard of a Shawna-key before. He plucked up courage to ask Elan the question that had been bothering him. ‘Is that a kind of a witch?’ ‘Oh no!’ she laughed. ‘Nora’s a Druid. She’s the guardian of the sacred grove, the keeper of secrets, and she knows the history of every tree in the forest.

‘Names are very important and powerful things, you can learn a lot from them. Arrana was given hers in Annwn before she came to Glasruhen.’ ‘An-noon. Where’s that?’ ‘It’s sometimes known as the Otherworld.’ Jack shook his head. He’d not heard of this place either. ‘Annwn is a land in another world, a place of peace and happiness, where it’s always summer. There used to be portals on Earth, secret gateways which could only be opened in certain ways at special times of the year. Only Druids had the knowledge and skill needed to perform the rituals that opened the gates. They each possessed a golden acorn. Without it they couldn’t pass between the two worlds. The one in your pocket is very special: it’s the only one left.’

Dad set it up. We picked sides. I called my side Mudlarks and he called his Brazil, so they all wanted to play on his side, of course. But Mum joined in on my side and we won. Mudlarks 5 – Brazil 3. Mum invited them back for a Coke on board afterwards. Stella growled at them and bared her teeth, so we had to shut her down in the cabin. They tried out their English on us.

One barrier to the expansion of wind power is social – some people object to wind farms as blights on the landscape, and obtaining permission to build them can be a challenge. However, off-shore wind farms that are located in the sea are likely to meet less resistance. But an additional problem is that wind energy could not currently provide the dominant source of energy in most countries because it is not a constant resource; if the weather changes, the electricity supply drops or even disappears. Again, the problem of storing electricity means that the intermittency of wind, and the fact that it can only produce significant amounts of electricity in particular locations, means that the prospects for capitalising on it are constrained. However, as a clean energy that is technologically simple to generate, wind energy holds a great deal of promise.

The reason for this is that the stress trajectories are diverted just as much by an area which strains too little, such as a stiff patch, as they are by an area which strains too much, such as a hole. Anything which is, so to speak, elastically out of step with the rest of the structure will cause a stress concentration and may therefore be dangerous.

As we said at the beginning of this chapter, all technological structures contain cracks and scratches and holes and other defects; ships and bridges and aircraft wings are liable to all sorts of accidental dents and abrasions and we have to learn to live with them as safely as may be, in spite of the fact that, according to Inglis, the local stress at many of these defects may be well above the official breaking stress of the material.

even if the local stress at the crack tip is very high − even if it is much higher than the ‘official’ tensile strength of the material − the structure is still safe and will not break so long as no crack or other opening is longer than the critical length Lg.

Droplets are generally spherical and the volume of a sphere is as the cube of its radius, whereas the surface area of a sphere is as the square of the radius. Thus, if two similar droplets were to join up so as to make one droplet of twice the volume, there would be a considerable net reduction in surface area and so in surface energy. So there is an energy incentive for the drops in an emulsion to coalesce and for the system to segregate into two continuous liquids.

One of the things we can do, and it may well be one of the most effective, is to add weight to the top of the wall. What then happens can be represented diagrammatically by Figure 9. Contrary to what one might suppose, weight at the top is likely to make a wall more, and not less, stable and will bring an erring thrust line back, more or less, to where it ought to be. One way to do this is simply to build the wall to a greater height than appears to be really necessary, and, in addition, anything like heavy balustrades and copings are a good thing. If it is that sort of building and you can afford it, a line of statues will always help (Figure 10). This is the structural justification for the pinnacles and statuary on Gothic churches and cathedrals.

The difficulty is that models are all very well if one just wants to see what the thing will look like, but they can be dangerously misleading if they are used to predict strength. This is because, as we scale up, the weight of the structure will increase as the cube of the dimensions; that is, if we double the size, the weight will increase eightfold. The cross-sectional areas of the various parts which have to carry this load will, however, increase only as the square of the dimensions, so that, in a structure of twice the size, such parts will have only four times the area. Thus the stress will go up linearly with the dimensions, and, if we double the size, we double the stress and we shall soon be in serious trouble.

In the same way the skin of young people has a low initial Young’s modulus and a low shear modulus and therefore conforms easily to the shape of the body.* In later life the skin becomes stiffer in shear, with obvious results.

To avoid this we put the steel reinforcing rods, which are inside the beam, permanently into tension, so that the concrete is permanently in compression. Thus the beam has to be bent considerably before the compressive stress in the concrete near the surface is relieved and replaced by a tension stress. Thus the cracking of the cement is postponed, since the beam has to be bent further before the critical tensile strain is reached.*

with increase of tensile strength. Thus in choosing a material for a tension member we are commonly faced with incompatible requirements. To reduce the weight of the middle or parallel part of a tie-bar we should like to use a material of high tensile strength. For the end fittings we generally want a tough material – which is only too likely to imply the acceptance of a low tensile strength. Like many difficulties, this one must be solved by a compromise, which in this case depends chiefly on the length of the member. For very long members, such as the wire cables of a modern suspension bridge, it will generally pay to choose a high tensile steel, even if we have to accept extra weight and complication in connection with the end fittings at the anchorages of the cables. After all, there are only two of these, one at each end of the bridge, while there is perhaps a mile of wire in between. Thus the saving of weight over the middle part will more than compensate for any losses at the ends. But when we come to things like chains with shortish links, the situation is totally different. In each short link the weight of the end fittings may well be greater than that of the middle part and must be carefully considered. This is the case with the supporting chains of the older suspension bridges. Such things were generally made from a tough and ductile wrought iron of quite low tensile strength. As we said in Chapter 10, the tensile stress in the plate links of Telford’s Menai bridge chains is less than a tenth of that in the wires of a modern suspension bridge – for this excellent reason.
